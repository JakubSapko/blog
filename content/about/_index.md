# Hi there!

My name is Jakub and I'm a Software Developer based in Warsaw, Poland. In work I mainly use languages like Python and Typescript but I'm also decent with Rust and Go.

## I've started my IT journey 18 years ago

When I was a child I got introduced to computers by my older sister. Together, we played (or rather I've watched her play) games like Super Mario Bros, Captain Claw (this one was a banger!) and some of the point'n'click adventure games from the era. Since then I've stumbled upon things like:

- Writing my first ever website, around 2010, about a band "Bring Me The Horizon" for my middleschool class (I have a special place in my heart for a ```<marquee>``` tag up to this day),
- Building my first ever robot for my mechatronics classes in middleschool and programming it's behavior in Scratch,
- Learning Pascal and C++ in my high school,
- Hosting my own Minecraft servers,
- Learning C++, Mathematica and Python when studying Physics in Uni,
- Eventually realizing that I spend most of free time writing software, creating Django apps and APIs, putting up fun simulations rather than solving sets of differential equations and thus switching my university for a Computer Science degree

## So, what do I do now?

For the past 3 years I've been programming commercialy for Merck (aka MSD) and since the last year I've been in a position of a Team Leader in our team. I do _everything_ including CLIs, services, APIs, internal tools, CI/CD stuff, infrastructure and so on, and so on.

Lately I've been really interested in the CyberSecurity, however I have no way of involving this in my day-to-day job so I decided that I'll create this blog to allow me to have a space for sharing what I've learned, what I've pwned and where I'm at in my CyberSec journey - as eventually I'll want to make it fulltime.

## If anyone ever reads this

I hope you'll learn __anything__ from this blog and you'll leave better than you've come!
